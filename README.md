# Operating-System
# Round-Robin Scheduling Simulator

This is a Python program that simulates the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm for a set of processes. It allows you to input the number of processes, their arrival times, execution times, and the quantum size. The program then simulates the execution of these processes and provides a Gantt chart and process control information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nabihafaisal/round-robin-scheduler.git

## Input Parameters
Number of processes: Enter the number of processes to be simulated within the specified range.

Execution time: Enter the execution time for each process within the specified range.

Quantum size: Enter the quantum size for the Round-Robin algorithm within the specified range.

## Output
The program will display a Gantt chart showing the timeline of process execution and various process control information, including turnaround time, utilization time, interrupt count, and more.
