# Operating-System

This repository contains Python programs that simulate scheduling algorithms for a set of processes. It includes implementations for both Round-Robin and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms.


## Round-Robin Scheduling Simulator

The Round-Robin scheduling algorithm is designed for preemptive scheduling, where each process is assigned a fixed time quantum for execution.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nabihafaisal/round-robin-scheduler.git

## Input Parameters
Number of processes: Enter the number of processes to be simulated within the specified range.

Execution time: Enter the execution time for each process within the specified range.

Quantum size: Enter the quantum size for the Round-Robin algorithm within the specified range.

## Output
The program will display a Gantt chart showing the timeline of process execution and various process control information, including turnaround time, utilization time, interrupt count, and more.

## Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Simulator
The Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm selects the process with the shortest execution time to run next (non-preemptive scheduling).

## Input Parameters
Number of processes: Enter the number of processes to be scheduled (between 3 and 5).

Arrival time: Enter the arrival time for each process.

Execution time: Enter the execution time for each process (must be less than or equal to 10).

## Output
The program will display a Gantt chart showing the timeline of process execution according to the SJF scheduling algorithm.
